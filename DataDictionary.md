#Data Dictionary

The variables generated by this program are based on the variables generated in the original data provided by the study.
The columns related to Standard Deviation and Mean have been subsetted from the original data and averaged by activity type and participant.

Note: the variable names below have the same name as the original variables embedded for your convenience. The name has been prepended with "SUMMAR
Y_" to indicate the new variable.

For detailed information about the variables refer to the README file in the data package.
